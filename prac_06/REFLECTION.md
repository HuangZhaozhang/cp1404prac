# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have intensified my code-writing practice, making a conscious effort to type code manually to deepen my impression and better understand its meaning.


## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

Methodologically, I avoid relying on AI for practice to enhance my independent thinking. 
In terms of application, I strive to use Python to design practical daily programs in life to improve my skills. 
Regarding task timing, I take breaks after 1-2 hours of work to maintain a clear mind. 
Attitudinally, I treat this subject seriously by carefully watching videos and PPTs, and attach great importance to the crucial final exam.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I will continue to complete the coding exercises assigned by the teacher and watch more learning videos to further my studies.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I will adjust my review plan and start preparing for the upcoming final exam.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

For this course, I hope there will be more in-class coding practice as well as learning about coding concepts and their applications.
